### Task:
A plank with a mass M 5 6.00 kg rests on top of two
identical, solid, cylindrical rollers that have R 5 5.00 cm
and m 5 2.00 kg (Fig. P10.87). The plank is pulled by a
constant horizontal force F S of magnitude 6.00 N
applied to the end of the plank and perpendicular to
the axes of the cylinders (which are parallel). The cylinders
roll without slipping on a flat surface. There is
also no slipping between the cylinders and the plank.
(a) Find the initial acceleration of the plank at the
moment the rollers are equidistant from the ends of
the plank. (b) Find the acceleration of the rollers at
this moment. (c) What friction forces are acting at this
moment?

### Answer:
Call ft the frictional force exerted by each roller
backward on the plank. Name as fb the rolling
resistance exerted backward by the ground on
each roller. Suppose the rollers are equally far
from the ends of the plank.
For the plank,
ΣFx = max 6.00 N − 2 ft = 6.00 kg ap b g
